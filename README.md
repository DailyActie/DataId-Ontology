# DataId-Ontology
The DBpedia DataID vocabulary is a meta-data system for detailed descriptions of datasets and their different manifestations, as well as their relation to agents like persons or organizations in regard to their rights and responsibilities.

Due to the gowing complexety and different usage purposes we unitized the DataID ontology in a core and multiple mid-layer ontologies. While the core ontology is a mandatory import for any of the mid-level ontologies presented, non of those are required to use for describing data with DataID. That said, in many use cases some or all of the mid-level ontologies will be a useful extension.
